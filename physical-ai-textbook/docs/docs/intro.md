# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Systems**

Welcome to an AI-native textbook that bridges the gap between pure software intelligence and physical robotics systems. This textbook is designed for learners from diverse backgrounds—whether you're a beginner exploring robotics, a software engineer entering Physical AI, or an AI researcher transitioning to embodied systems.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers the complete journey from digital intelligence to embodied humanoid systems:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understand how ROS 2 enables communication, control, and coordination in physical AI systems
- **Module 2: Digital Twins & Simulation** - Learn to create and test robot behaviors in virtual environments
- **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac - The AI Robot Brain** - Discover how AI models perceive and reason in physical spaces
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Systems (Capstone)** - Master the integration of language understanding with robotic actions, synthesizing all four modules into autonomous humanoid systems

## How to Use This Textbook

### For Self-Study

Each module is structured with:
- **Clear Learning Objectives** - Know exactly what you'll understand after each chapter
- **Conceptual Explanations** - Grasp the "why" before the "how"
- **Practical Examples** - See concepts applied to real humanoid robotics scenarios
- **Summaries** - Reinforce key takeaways

### With the AI Chatbot

This textbook features an embedded RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that can:
- Answer questions about any concept in the book
- Adapt explanations to your background (Beginner, Software Engineer, Robotics Student, AI Researcher)
- Provide clarifications on specific text you select
- Help you test your understanding

### Learning Paths

**Path 1: Complete Beginner**
Start with Module 1 to understand the foundational concepts. Take your time with each chapter, use the chatbot for clarifications, and don't skip the summaries.

**Path 2: Software Engineer**
You can move quickly through Module 1, focusing on how ROS 2 compares to distributed systems you already know. The chatbot can draw parallels to web APIs and microservices.

**Path 3: Robotics Student**
If you're familiar with kinematics and control theory, Module 1 will show you how AI integrates with robot control. The chatbot can connect concepts to control theory you already understand.

**Path 4: AI Researcher**
You can skim Module 1 for ROS 2 basics and focus on Module 3-4 for AI-specific topics. The chatbot can explain embodied AI concepts in terms of ML systems.

## Get Started

Begin your journey with **[Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](./module-1-ros2/chapter-1-introduction-to-ros2)**, where you'll learn how ROS 2 serves as the communication backbone for physical AI systems.

Or, if you want to see the capstone synthesis, jump to **[Module 4: Vision-Language-Action](./module-4-vision-language-action/chapter-1-introduction-to-vla)** to understand how natural language commands translate to robot actions in autonomous humanoid systems.

## About This Project
