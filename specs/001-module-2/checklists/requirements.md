# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 2 - The Digital Twin

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items validated

**Details**:
- **Content Quality**: PASS - Spec focuses on educational outcomes (what students learn) rather than technical implementation (how content is delivered). Written for educators and curriculum designers.
- **Requirement Completeness**: PASS - All 37 functional requirements are testable (word counts, content requirements, structural elements). No clarification markers present. Success criteria are measurable (90% comprehension rate, 85% quiz pass rate, specific word counts).
- **Feature Readiness**: PASS - Three prioritized user stories cover the learning journey from fundamentals (P1) to technical architecture (P2) to advanced application (P3). Each story has specific acceptance scenarios.
- **Technology Agnostic**: PASS - Success criteria describe student outcomes (can define digital twin, can describe simulation pipeline) without specifying technical implementation details.

## Notes

- **Educational Focus**: This specification differs from typical software specs as it defines educational content requirements rather than software features. The "users" are students, and "success" is measured by learning outcomes.
- **Module 1 Dependency**: Specification correctly assumes Module 1 completion and references it appropriately in dependencies and assumptions sections.
- **No Clarifications Needed**: All requirements are well-defined with clear word counts, content requirements, and quality standards based on Module 1 precedent.
- **Ready for Planning**: Spec provides sufficient detail for planning the content creation process (research, writing, review cycles) without requiring additional clarification.
